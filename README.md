# bundle-lib
A library for mindustry mods to change mod name and description in terms of game language.

You can try it by setting game language to english first and then french(the only languages available for now, new bundles are welcome). The name and description change !


# How to use
Copy the "bundle-lib.js" file and paste it in the "scripts" folder of your mod (don't forget to change main.js if you're using one.)

In your bundle files, you'll need to add mod.(name of your mod).displayName and same for description, see in the library bundles.

Then let the magic happen !

Feel free to credit me, and enjoy !
