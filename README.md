# bundle-lib
A library for mindustry mods to change mod name and description in terms of game language.

You can try it by setting game language to english first and then french(the only languages available for now). The name and description change !

Actually I would like to do a more proper thing using bundles but I sadly got blocked by Great Anuke Wall.

# How to use
Copy the "bundle-lib.js" file and paste it in the "scripts" folder of your mod (don't forget to change main.js if you're using one.)

Then you must a few things, follow the instructions in code comments !

Feel free to credit me, and enjoy !
